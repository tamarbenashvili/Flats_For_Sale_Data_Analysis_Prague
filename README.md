# Flats_For_Sale_Data_Analysis_Prague

This project aims to analyse the factors that drive the prices of flats in Prague. The data was obtained from sreality.cz using web scraping method. For data analysis and visualization I used python.
I include both files: web scraping and data analysis as jupyter notebooks.
